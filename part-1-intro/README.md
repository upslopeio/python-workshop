# Python Introduction

## Check Your Version

Which version of Python do you have?

```
python --version
```

Most systems have Python 2 installed by default. You may _also_ have Python 3 installed, but it might be named `python3`:

```
python3 --version
```

**Alternately** you might have Python named `python2`:

```
python2 --version
```

## Download Python 3 (if you need it)

https://www.python.org/downloads/

If you are on a mac, you can also run:

```
brew install python
```

## Virtual Environments

You can install python packages with a tool called `pip` (which might be `pip3` on your machine).

But you might have different projects that rely on different Python versions:
